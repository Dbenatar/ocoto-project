          The Gup-A is a multi-purpose vehicle based on an anglerfish. Its speed
          is moderate, but it has a turbo booster can make it go almost as fast

        <p>
          The Gup-B is a shark-styled Gup with one seat. Known for its fast
          speed and acceleration, it is Kwazii's favorite Gup. He mainly uses it
          for almost all the missions the Octonauts go on, takes it out for solo
          missions, or to just have fun driving it around, such as racing with
          fast creature. It is also the fastest Gup of all, even faster than the
          Gup-R.

          The Gup-C is a big, blue Gup with a large towline. It is Shellington
          and Dashi's favorite. The towline is for pulling Gups out of wedged
          objects, for example, rocks. The window at the top is used for the
          icebreaker attachment. With the exception of Professor Inkling Octopus
          and the Vegimals, all the Octonauts have driven the Gup-C.

          windows can be opened to allow creatures and Octonauts to enter and

          The Gup-F was a pedal-powered Gup, and the first one Tweak had ever
          created. It ranks as the slowest-moving Gup.It was made to look like
          an X-ray fish. It did not have any real interior or exterior, but a
          basic metal frame with controls.

          The Gup I is a mobile ice research station built for freezing
          conditions. According to Tweak, the "I" stands for ice. The design is
          based on the tardigrade and is from Professor Natquik's old ice
          research station which Tweak remodeled it into the Gup I.

          The Gup-K is half swamp boat and half tank. Barnacles drives the Gup-K
          in The Great Swamp Search episode to save invasive species from
          Tweak's home, the Everglades, from a wildfire. Its design is based off
          of an alligator. Tweak had the idea for this Gup since she was a
          little bunny.

          where Tweak, Codish, and Grouber use them to search the Yucatan Jungle
          to find Barnacles and Peso Shellington's nephew Periwinkle even made a
