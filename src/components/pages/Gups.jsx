          The Gup-B is a shark-styled Gup with one seat. Known for its fast
          speed and acceleration, it is Kwazii's favorite Gup. He mainly uses it
          for almost all the missions the Octonauts go on, takes it out for solo
          missions, or to just have fun driving it around, such as racing with
          fast creature. It is also the fastest Gup of all, even faster than the

          The Gup-C is a big, blue Gup with a large towline. It is Shellington

          objects, for example, rocks. The window at the top is used for the
          icebreaker attachment. With the exception of Professor Inkling Octopus

        <p>
          The Gup-Z is the first 5-in-1 Gup, meaning almost everyone can use it.
          It can split into five separate Gups, so everyone can drive in
          different parts, and it can combine into a giant robot. It is the
          ultimate Gup for saving creatures from erupting undersea volcanoes. It
          is based on a vent shrimp.
